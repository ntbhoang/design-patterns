Having an object with 10 constructors arguments is not productive and creates a lot of boilerplate code, confusing.
Instead opt for piecewise construction. Builder pattern is a good choice for this.
Builder pattern provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.
It is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters.
